# Overview

This is a Budget app written in Kotlin that I created to learn the language. I also used Firestore as a cloud databse.

Currently, the program support the following features:
- Add/edit/delete income
- Add/edit/delete expense
- Display summary of incomes, expenses, how much was spent by category, and final balance
- Add categories to expenses
- Add a budget for each category    
- Delete all data

All the income and expense data are stored in a Firestore cloud database.

This program was created to test the environment of Kotlin using Intellij IDEA Community Version, git, and GitHub.
